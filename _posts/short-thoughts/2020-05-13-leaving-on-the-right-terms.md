Provided the human race does not clumsily steer itself into extinction then it is likely our age of discovery will resurface in space. Instead of asking what we might hope to find, we should instead be asking what are we hoping to leave behind.

The terms of exit are rather important - do we want to consider ourselves guardians and explorers or arsenists and pillagers. The former two formulate a future full of hope and a purpose-led case for humanity. A vision of the latter two can leave us stratching our heads asking ourselves -'what is the point of us?'.
