 <p>When I zoom out a bit I tend to think about the series of paintings titled <i>Course of Empires</i>by Thomas Cole. Seeing these painting up close and it feels a story is unfolding before our eyes. The story of us.  
 There seems to be the necessary need for society to operate somewhere between stage 2 and 3 to avoid the entropy of stage 4 - destruction. Perhaps around the 2.7-2.8 mark. This is where the balance is found between staying true to who we are as living beings and where we have come from and coupling it with the creative potential of humanity. To progress we need the latter, to do so wisely we need the former.  </p> 

 The series serves a reminder that we need to not only remember where we come from (1+2), but find a way to embed it into our civilisation (3) so as to avoid our decadence (4). The Final painting, the desolution, shows the fragility of our own creations compared to the works of nature. (Goethes painting)
