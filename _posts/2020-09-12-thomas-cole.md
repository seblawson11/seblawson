 <p>When I zoom out a bit I tend to think about the series of paintings titled <i>Course of Empires</i>by Thomas Cole. Seeing these painting up close and it feels a story is unfolding before our eyes. The story of us.  </p>

 It starts with the savage state, the kind of world you might have imagined Adam and Eve encountering when kicked out of Eden. It is a world of scattered humans. As the painting shows nature dominates, it is free of human impact. A solitary figure wanders bruised desperately seeking food. The world feels a long way from being his playground, it is brutal and harsh yet indifferent to his existence. Yet the figure soon meets others like himself and in the background you can see the first embers of a fire. The start of what was to come. A resource from nature requiring human hands to utilise, to ascribe purpose. 

 In the second of the series nature still dominates the painting yet it is less hostile, less biblical. Humans are beginning to show their proclivity to add order to complexity. The first pillars of a temple begins to puff smoke. Humans are beginning to claim agency over the land, further straying from their origins. They are now settlers rather than wanderers. All seems peaceful, nature is not rattled and their seems to be some newfound harmony between human ingenuity and the land they occupy. In the background the first signs of industry emerge, progress will not just become a word but a necessity. The beginnings of worship. 

 There seems to be the necessary need for society to operate somewhere between stage 2 and 3 to avoid the entropy of stage 4 - destruction. Perhaps around the 2.7-2.8 mark. This is where the balance is found between staying true to who we are as living beings and where we have come from and coupling it with the creative potential of humanity. To progress we need the latter, to do so wisely we need the former. 

 The series serves a reminder that we need to not only remember where we come from (1+2), but find a way to embed it into our civilisation (3) so as to avoid our decadence (4). The Final painting, the desolution, shows the fragility of our own creations compared to the works of nature. (Goethes painting)
