Late in Aldous Huxley&#39;s life he decided to revisit the themes of his most popular novel &#39;Brave New World&#39; through a series of essays titled &#39;Brave New World Revisited&#39;. This collection of essays gives a pretty damning verdict as to the state of western society, the themes of his novel published 30 years prior seemed to have become more apparent in everyday life. Tucked in the middle of this book are a couple of chapters entitled &#39;propaganda in a democratic society&#39; and &#39;propaganda in a dictatorship&#39;. The essays as a whole should be essential reading for anyone wishing to starve off the kind of dreamy dystopia Huxley envisaged as opposed to the more rugged dystopia of Orwell&#39;s &#39;1984&#39;, but it is these two essays that particularly strike a chord with the increasing bilateral access we have in modernity between the elected and the electorate, and the dangers that this may bring.

<h3><b>Propaganda in a Democratic Society</b></h3>

Given many of us live in &#39;democracies&#39; its best to start with the less unpalatable propaganda in a democratic society. According to Huxley democratic institutions provide social order in partnership with a necessary amount of individual autonomy and freedom, whilst allowing rulers to be subject to the ruled. While this may not always be the most effective form of governance it is very much the depiction of democracy we have settled in our minds.

Huxley sees two trends that have begun to take effect that have consequently weakened the efficiency of the democratic institutions we value so highly. One being overpopulation, the other being over-organisation. This was written in the late 1950s when the world population stood a little under 3 billion. Huxley sees these two growing problems have led to a wane of the democratic freedom that the west had enjoyed for so long. We have had the gift of self-governance and yet due to the difficulty in reconciling this among millions of people, it leaves the door open for individual politicians to gain power. This is probably the most important modern critique of democracy – that being it doesn&#39;t scale well.

Propaganda is at the heart of a transition from democracy to something towards dictatorship, it is tool democratic politicians may use to cultivate power. Huxley distinguishes between rational and non-rational propaganda. Non-rational propaganda being defined as &quot;that which is not consonant with anybody&#39;s enlightened self-interest, but is dictated by, and appeals to, passions, blind impulses, unconscious craving or fears&quot;. Rational propaganda on the other hand promotes the country&#39;s long-term self-interest, which Huxley believes can lead to &quot;an earthly paradise&quot;. While this may be a little too utopian to stomach it is a considerably more effective approach than the contrary. Unfortunately as Huxley warned decades ago, we seem closer to the non-rational form, propaganda has been used more to appeal to our collective emotions rather than our individual long-term needs.

An obvious way in which this divergence occurs is with the use of the term &#39;the facts&#39;. In Politics, unlike science, it can be more difficult to determine what the pertinent facts may be, a problem that has plagued both ethics and religion. If they are determined then the interpretation of these facts are dependent your own system of ideas. The danger lies in that we have insufficient time to determine the full picture of events. The means of mass communication chuck so much at us that &quot;we are forced to act on insufficient evidence and by a light considerably less steady than logic&quot;. This has only become more pervasive since Huxley&#39;s time. The technological means of mass communication have no inherent allegiance meaning they can either be used well or unwell. Propaganda can be used to promote democracy or to power dictatorship, or the more modern equivalent of authoritarianism.

The role of non-rational propaganda through new technologies has perhaps seen society tilt further away from democracy providing an easier breeding ground for a dictatorship. As Huxley wanted to show, the tool that could help ease this process was the use of distraction. Propaganda not only incorporates the dichotomy over what is true and what is false, but now includes the totally irrelevant, in the hope that it satisfies our &quot;almost infinite appetite for distractions&quot;. If it wasn&#39;t already hard enough to determine the facts and then to sufficiently digest them in a logical manner, the ubiquity of distraction has made it perhaps impossible in many cases to understand the full picture. We do not have the time to think clearly if we are constantly consuming propaganda, where we will not know whether what we encounter is the truth or the false or merely seductive distraction.

In Huxley&#39;s futuristic dystopian novel &#39;Brave New World&#39;, distractions are used as a political tool, they are policy instruments to prevent citizens from &quot;paying too much attention to the realities of the social and political situation&quot;. Looking back on his novel almost 30 years later Huxley saw a world slipping closer to the one he had warned of decades ago in his novel. With over 60 years since Huxley&#39;s reflections it seems clear that we live in a time where his warning still resonates, perhaps even a little louder. We could consider entertainment is the new &#39;opium of the people&#39;, or say social media and the newspapers are great muddlers of the truth. Whilst politicians themselves have not bound these instruments to the state, it has certainly provided leeway for their political ambition.

Huxley finishes the essay with a definition of the modern use of political propaganda in that it relies &quot;for the most part on repetition, suppression and rationalization – the repetition of catchwords which wish to be accepted as true, the suppression of facts which they wish to be ignored, the arousal and rationalization of passions which may be used in the interests of the party or the state&quot;. Given this feels a little closer to the bone for modern western politics it is rather scary that Huxley here was actually referring to the use of propaganda by modern dictators. To see where this might lead us Huxley&#39;s next essay can provide some clarity.

<h3><b>Propaganda in a Dictatorship</b></h3>

What Huxley is really exploring in this next essay is the question of how did Hitler political rise reach such a crescendo of power. In doing so he provides a stark warning into the dangers of groupthink and the subtlety with which devious politicians can suddenly be in the hot seat having exploited mass psychology. A huge part of Hitler&#39;s artillery for cajoling the masses was his use of technology.

In a nod to Orwell, Huxley states &quot;thanks to technological progress, Big Brother can now be almost as omnipresent as God&quot;. Mass manipulation hasn&#39;t become an experiment in political rhetoric, but is now scientific - or algorithmic as we would say now. Huxley showcases Hitler&#39;s rise as an example of the mind-control of the masses he feared becoming subversive to western democracies. Modern dictators had at their hands new technology to reach into the ears and minds of the masses. Technology, as Huxley new, is neither morally good nor bad but instead can be used as a tool to do good or bad. Hitler was an adept user of the radio. Through his broadcasts he could get inside the heads of millions of listeners and slowly promote his own narrative upon people, &quot;depriving them of independent thought&quot; – as Albert Speer said.

Hitler&#39;s understanding of mass behaviour did unfortunately go deeper than the radio, he knew that to truly manipulate the masses he needed to gather them together and stir their emotions. This instinctive reaction to his charismatic oration feeds of the emotive reactions of others. As Huxley notes &quot;assembled in a crowd, people lose their powers of reasoning and their capacity for moral choice… they become very excitable, they lose all sense of individual or collective responsibility.&quot; Perhaps this all seems a little farfetched in modernity where we might say we have reached a level of political maturity so as not to be fooled by the rhetoric of our leaders. We know too much to be put into boxes, we are too wise to feel the powerful gravity of mass psychology. We might feel we are not fooled by rallying cries because we have learnt from the past. This all seems a lofty and rather cloudy depiction of the modern citizen. If we were to really learn from the past we would realise that some things are a lot easier to work out retrospectively. We can point are finger at the mistakes of the past, question the intelligence of a well-educated nation whilst the same thing may be going on in our own time through entirely different channels. As history shows new technology provides new ways for a politician to fool the masses with their unbeholden beliefs, it is a shame the tactical battle is fought over how to do this rather than ideas that underpin it.

Where Huxley does begin to really strike a chord with modernity is when he moves on to the use of propaganda by the dictator. First he distinguishes between philosophy and propaganda – the first being a healthy scepticism for that which seems self-evident to us and the latter being to accept as self-evident that which we should make us &quot;suspend our judgement or to feel doubt&quot;. Hitler wrote about effective propaganda as if there was a clear methodology to its success; a how-to guide for dictators. An example being the propagandist should take one side of an argument and never sway. Never should the propagandist admit they are wrong or admit those they disagree with may be somewhat correct on a subject of contention. Instead of attempting to reason with these opponents the propagandist dictator should attack them, shout at them perhaps. They should deny they have anything useful to say, twist the truth in appeal to masses. Perhaps this starts to feel more familiar to us.

Hitler would not have been in a position of power if it wasn&#39;t for his clear understanding of mass psychology, while deranged on other matters his knowledge of how propaganda can appeal to the masses proved unfortunately effective. The outcome according to Huxley was &quot;herd-poisoning&quot;. Huxley&#39;s solution, much like Thoreau, was that people should learn to think for themselves. Thoreau thought it best to serve your own mind in order to improve civil society. Huxley operates along similar lines but more so to protect yourself from the spell that can be cast over the masses, he goes on to say &quot;mindlessness and moral idiocy are not characteristically human attributes; they are symptoms of herd poisoning&quot;. By Huxley&#39;s reckoning to look at people as simply members of the masses Hitler got his assessment of human nature correct, but to look at people as individuals in their own right he got it sadistically wrong. The fact that he was allowed to prevail should be a warning to us all. We are all fundamentally different, and as Huxley rightly knew democracy is the least-worst political culture we have to accommodate this peacefully.

<h3>The Paradoxical Warning</h3>
Looking at propaganda both in both a democracy and a dictatorship it&#39;s difficult to decipher which camp we may sit in at the moment. Perhaps we are on the edge of one not knowing we may well fall into the other. Unfortunately this is kernel to what Huxley is saying, that if we don&#39;t know if we are where we don&#39;t want to be then we may already be there. Not quite QED, but it couldn&#39;t hurt to assume the transition from democracy to dictatorship may be more subtle than expected. Thankfully no modern democracies have a Hitler in power, but if anything Huxley shows how easy it might be to wake up one day and realise it&#39;s too late. Propaganda is a powerful tool and technology provides new mediums with which to orchestrate it to the masses. What is crucial to this in Huxley&#39;s message is how distractions may be used in a propaganda; if we can say anything about modern democracies it is that we have plenty of things to distract us.

It will not help to awash ourselves with conspiracy theories but instead Huxley would suggest we take some time every now and then to check our premises, perhaps sit in a corner and think independently. We may conclude that social media has become the new masses, soundbites the new oration but all we can do is check are behaviour is not simply following the herd but is instead a conclusion we have come to in our own minds as to what is right and what is wrong irrespective of how many people may be following suit. Groups can distort our own thinking – so it would be better to think first then get together in groups, otherwise we may find ourselves in a constant reactionary state.

Huxley&#39;s intelligence was immense and yet his message is largely lost in our own age. Psychedelics became his source of fascination in later life, perhaps because he was tired of society largely ignoring the messages from his books whilst praising his ideas. But tucked away during phase two of his literary journey was this powerful collection of essays where the irony would probably not be lost on him that it is not better known and its ideas not better followed.
