<h2>Volume Two: <i>In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower</i></h2>

(Pg) 14/ when our wish to be touched by nature or art is prompted by the hope of a grandiose revelation, we are loth to let it be replaced by lesser impressions, which might mislead us as to the true value of beauty.
34/ in politics, it was a mark of superiority rather than inferiority to repeat what everyone else thought
57/ theoretically we are aware that the earth is spinning, but in reality we do not notice it: the ground we walk on seems to be stationary and gives no cause for alarm. The same happens with time. To makes its passing perceptible, novelists have to turn the hands of the clock at dizzying speeds, to make the reader live through 10, 20, 30 years in two minutes.
64/ when we look at the person we love, our inquisitive, anxious, demanding gaze, our expectations of the words which will make us hope for (or despair of) another meeting tomorrow and, until those words are spoken, our obsession fluctuating between possible joy and sorrow, or imagining both of these together, all this distracts our tremulous attention and prevents it from getting a clear picture of the loved one
190/ regret, like desire, seeks satisfaction and not self-analysis
197-198/ to be no longer in love is to know that forgetting - or even a fading memory- causes much less pain than the unhappiness of loving
206/ unhappiness is a great promoter of morality
223/ habit may weaken all things, but it also stabilises them; it brings about a dislocation, but then makes it last indefinitely
249-250/
292/ on beauty at first sight
343/ life is, alas, so badly arranged that we are rarely enjoy that happiness (from love)
346/ (m. De Charles speaking) it is the height of stupidity to think there is something ridiculous or reprehensible I’m feelings one does not share
368/ on beauty at first sight
442/ on imperfection
448/ when a journey we have longed to make begins to become a reality, and the mind and sensibility are starting to wonder whether it is really worth the effort, the will, which well knows that, if it turned out the journey could not be made, these feckless masters would immediately long for it to become possible again, let’s them loiter in front of the station, having their say, hesitating until the last minute, while it makes sure of buying the tickets and getting us into the train before departure time.
