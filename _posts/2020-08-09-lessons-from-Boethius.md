Boethius’s short and adventurous book ‘the consolations of philosophy’ is an example of philosophy in its most basic orientation and subsequently its most useful, it offers guidance for the inevitable difficulties of life. It is short exploration that uses both poetry and an imagined conversation between Boethius himself and lady philosophy in order to determine how we might live our lives with less of the psychological pitfalls that can so often dampen our experience. At its most powerful it tells us how we might cope with life even when fortune may not be in our favour.

The book is rich in guidance and is the last work of classical stoic philosophy. From it one can extract a number of pertinent lessons for the 21st century. Here are just a few of Boethius’s teachings narrated through the consoling voice of Lady Philosophy:

<br>

### 1.	Shared suffering 
Fortune ensures that we all suffer in ways that are out of our hands. This is an inevitability of life. Buddhism’s first noble truth that ‘life is suffering’, or more accurately that life will involve some suffering, seems a good place to start. Yet in each of us there is a tendency to feel that the cards fortune has dealt us are the cruellest. As Boethius states:

> No one finds it easy to accept the lot Fortune has sent him. There is something in the case of each of us that escapes the notice of the man who has not experienced it, but causes horror to the man who has

Instead of dwelling on our own misfortune it may better to realise that we are all suffering or will suffer from an occurrence out of our hands. It is best to become aware and accept that the most seemingly fortunate of us may soon be prey to the most unforgiving of circumstances. In this knowledge we may come to celebrate a day where nothing seems to have gone wrong, because to be human is to constantly expose ourselves to the unpredictability of the world and that which is out of our control. This realisation is the lifeblood of stoicism. 
Boethius came from wealth and soon had a loving family alongside an impressive job in politics but he was later falsely accused of plotting against the paranoid king and put in jail (where he wrote the Consolations of Philosophy), and shortly after was executed. His life is very much an example of the vicissitudes he wrote that we all may suffer from.

### 2.	Should we seek fame 
Considering Boethius is writing in the 6th Century AD he talks a lot about fame, which many will feel is largely a modern condition. 
While the multiplicative effect of spreading fame is more pronounced in modernity, Lady Philosophy’s dissection of the limits of fame are still germane. She starts off by signalling how small earth is in the sky and how little of life on this small planet would grasp the concept of fame, let alone be able to identify an individual as famous. Within our own species there are also limits to fame’s reach. Thanks to the greater interconnectivity of the world many on the planet can now be familiar with the appearances and heroism of one person. Yet the same limits apply, most of these people you will never meet so why does it matter that they should know your name? Or worse if so many people know your name but only through whispers and speculation then they will only see an abstraction of yourself, a caricature of who you really are. 
	Boethius also covers those who seek fame for virtue, which is evidently not just a modern condition. The argument is laid out:
>what do they care about reputation when the body grows lifeless in death which ends all things? If the whole of man dies, body and soul – a belief which our reason forbids us – fame is nothing at all, since the man who is said to have won it doesn’t exist.

Marcus Aurelius suggested a similar approach – that the thought of death is the best stopper to seeking fame.

Later on in the book fame is denounced again:

>fame, in fact, is a shameful thing, and so often deceptive… even if the praise is deserved, it cannot add anything to the philosopher’s feelings: he measures happiness not by popularity, but by the true voice of his own conscience.

Fame is not something we should seek because to do so would be to govern our lives through extrinsic motivation whereby we distance ourselves from our own neglected thoughts. To seek something that is largely out of our hands provides no guarantees, to do so for fame is foolish. The best remedy for those seeking fame as Lady Philosophy signals, and as Marcus Aurelius alluded to, is to be aware that one day our lives will end. To live well it is better to stick to our own intrinsic motivations.

### 3.	On the downside of wealth 
> my contention is that no good thing harms its owner, a thing which you won’t gainsay. But wealth very often does harm its owners, for all the most criminal elements of the population who are thereby all the more covetous of other people’s property are convinced that they alone are worthy to possess all the gold and precious stones there are.

Wealth is not an inherently bad thing but anyone who wishes to gain wealth in order to liberate themselves should be subsequently wary of the paradox of wealth, in that seeking it to make you more free may well leave you a prisoner to its creation and accumulation. It can leave us with a heavy appetite.

### 4.	On what it means to be virtuous 
 >virtue has her own individual worth, which she immediately transfers to whoever possesses her. But as public offices cannot do this, it is clear that they have no beauty or worth of their own 

Being virtuous is not something that is out of our control that may immediately be transferred to us when we are put in a so-called ‘virtuous position’. One only has to look at politicians today to see how untrue that may be. Boethius contends that virtue is one of the few resources we have that is not subject to the vagaries of fortune. It is in our own hands. So-called status does not signal virtuous.

### 5.	On seeking things outside of ourselves 
It should not be discouraged but should merely come with a warning that what one conspires in one’s head can be washed away by fortunes wheel. For example a pandemic may have ruined your dream of opening a restaurant. To hedge yourself against misfortune we should also remember to seek things within the more controllable world of ourselves. It may be best not to rely too heavily on those things fortune can suddenly take away from us, or at least to accept the possibility. To picture this Lady philosophy introduces the wheel of fortune – we can play the game but cannot blame the game when it goes wrong. We should have something else, more controllable, to anchor our fulfilment to.

> there is no doubt then, that these roads to happiness are side-tracks and cannot bring us to the destination they promise. The evils with which they are beset are great, as I will briefly show you. If you try to hoard money, you will have to take it by force. If you want to be resplendent in the dignities of high office, you will have to grovel before the man who bestows it: in your desire to outdo others in high honour you will have to cheapen and humiliate yourself by begging. If you want power, you will have to expose yourself to the plots of your subjects and run dangerous risks. If fame is what you seek, you will find yourself on a hard road, drawn this and that until you are worn with care. Decide to lead a life of pleasure, and there will be no one who will not reject you with scorn as the slave of that most worthless and brittle master, the human body.

Like most great works each reader will take away something different from Boethius’s consolations. An enthusiast of philosophy hoping to convince a sceptic of the subjects utility in our everyday lives should pass over a copy. There can be no higher praise than that for a work of philosophy.
