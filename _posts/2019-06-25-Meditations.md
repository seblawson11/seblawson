The collection of writings are filled with eternal wisdom, and each reader will be blessed by taking something unique from a steady exploration of this wisdom. From my own experience this is the most notable trait of good art and writing in general: it tailors its aesthetic or lyrical, or prosed impact without change. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb concludes in *Skin in the Game* *"not everything that happens happens for a reason, but everything that survives survives for a reason"*. This work survives because it is still pertinent, the essence of humanity remains stubborn despite all the change around it. Each reader will find something that resonates. 
 
 While it was rare to find a passage not appropriate for the 21st century I have picked out a few passages that particularly struck a chord:

> *We were born for cooperation. So to work in opposition to one another is against nature: and anger or rejection is opposition*

Looking atavistically the evidence seems to point to the fact that humans are intrinsically social beings. In Economics their has been a push by Raworth among others to remove ourselves from the image of homo economicus to an image of economic agents thriving from interaction with our fellow human beings.


> *Have I done something for the common good, then I too have benefitted*

This seems very applicable for environmental protection or sustainable habits: it should not be considered an altruistic deed because it is benefitting yourself so should not be considered a virtue but a case of rational decision-making.

> *I have often wondered how it is that everyone loves himself more than anyone else, but rates his own judgement of himself below that of others*
