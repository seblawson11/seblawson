#The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius 

##On our relationship with humanity 

> We were born for cooperation. So to work in opposition to one another is against nature: and anger or rejection is opposition 

> Men are born for the sake of eachother. So either teach or tolerate 

> Have I done something for the common good, then I too have benefitted 

> I have often wondered how it is that everyone loves himself more than anyone else, but rates his own judgement of himself below that of others
