<h1>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</h1>

##On our relationship with humanity 

> We were born for cooperation. So to work in opposition to one another is against nature: and anger or rejection is opposition 

Looking atavistically the evidence seems to point to the fact that humans are intrinsically social beings. In Economics their has been a push by Raworth amoung others to remove ourselves from the image of homo economicus to an image of economic agents thriving from interaction.

> *Men are born for the sake of eachother. So either teach or tolerate*

> Have I done something for the common good, then I too have benefitted 

> I have often wondered how it is that everyone loves himself more than anyone else, but rates his own judgement of himself below that of others
