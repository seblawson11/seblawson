The story goes that if you are a rocket scientist in the real world (highly unlikely) then you will attract insurmountable attention from those around you. At a party you are the topic of conversation - people toast to your noble profession with uncharactersitic and slightly unnerving sincerity. On the other hand if you are a call-centre worker then people may awkwardly provide a polite excitement with their voice, whilst their face remains frozen from the panic-inducing reality at being stuck at a party with no work-related questions to ask (of course we should ideally live in a world where people are not defined by their business cards but we are unfortunately yet to make this mature transition). Now if you were to take those two individuals and place them into nature you will get a very different response. Well in fact you get no response at all because nature doesn’t care. The call-centre worker becomes a human and the rocket scientist becomes a human; both people may be genuinely interesting to the other person, but to nature the whims and idiosyncrasies of both individuals are an irrelevance. 

How refreshing it is to know that everyone has a place in this world simply because nature doesn’t care about you. Admittedly this sounds slightly paradoxical because in society if something doesn’t care about your existence it is usually a bad sign for humans as it is often taken that something is fundamentally wrong with you - maybe you’re suffering from loneliness and the self-criticism it brings or you simply feel a small cog in a giant industrial machine. The pleasing thing about nature not caring is that it isn’t a choice, nature doesn’t discriminate. It simply is. It doesn’t see the charismatic rocket scientist and bask them in sunshine or blossom its flowers upon arrival, whilst the surly call-centre worker gets a branch blowing into their face. Nature is, by its very definition, indifferent to what we consider important in our everyday lives - it has no intention. Because of this it cannot be seduced by all that prevents our happiness in our lives away from nature. The reverse of this is that your sense of achievement in your own life isn’t going to be considered let alone appreciated by nature. Trees cannot experience schadenfreude (experiencing pleasure from others misfortune) or mitfreude (being happy when others discover happiness). In both of these circumstances, hubris or no hubris, nature can provide a uniquely cathartic experience for the rocket scientist or the call-centre worker or the anxious or the ecstatic. Nature can rejuvenate, it can humble, but it can never judge. 

So long as the ability to surround yourself with nature exists humans will always have a tonic for suffering, you may even feel free to take more risks because this part of your world doesn’t care if you fail. What this presents is an absurdist mindset when you return to ‘civilisation’, the idea that what you previously considered important seems suddenly ridiculous. Most of your value system loses importance. Those values that survive natures filter grow in importance and what it is that you really value becomes a little clearer– it may be finding happiness, building healthy relationships or simply finding something to do in your life that you can extract fulfillment from. The Stoics encouraged rich people anxious about losing their fortune to spend time living as dog, to prove they could still survive as a penniless person. What stoicism deemed an appropriate solution for financial anxiety, draws parallels to the simple therapy that time spent in nature provides for our most pernicious sources of angst. Everyone should spend time in nature simply because we live in a world where people spend a lot of money trying to relieve stress and anxiety. Nature is largely free and is one of the most effective therapies there is for the worries of modernity. Standing in a wide valley surrounded by unperturbed mountains, or simply sitting on a park bench watching the leaves fall can leave you feeling utterly insignificant. Yet without the toxic intention behind it this feeling is liberating not isolating. In that moment of cathartic stillness we realise how in society we champion so much and appreciate so little. This lesson is in our parks and our gardens not just our mountains and lakes. It should be used, not scarred. 

Many of our modern problems are rooted in an inability to escape time, nature helps you escape time.
