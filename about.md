This is a collection of random writings about whatever I feel is worth discussing. Topics are likely to be eclectic covering topics such as philosophy, politics and literature. I apologize for the randomness (and probably infrequency) of the posts, but this is merely due to the fact that a write whenever I have such an urge. Writing is a tool that brings clarity to thoughts; I will do my best to work out which of those thoughts are worth sharing, and which, on later reflection, can end as a fleeting moment of nonsense. I promise it will remain less bloggy than a blog and more bloggy than twitter.
