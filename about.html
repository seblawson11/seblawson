<!-- This is a collection of random writings about whatever I feel is worth thinking about or discussing. Topics are likely to be eclectic. I apologize for the randomness (and probably infrequency) of the posts, but this is merely due to the fact that a write whenever I have such an urge (usually post-travelling). Writing is a tool that brings clarity to thoughts; I will do my best to work out which of those thoughts are worth sharing and those, upon later reflection, can end as a fleeting moment of nonsense. I promise it will remain less bloggy than a blog and more bloggy than twitter.

In search of answers to big questions
